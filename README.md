# HuffmanEncoding

In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding.

In this project huffman Coding is implemented using greedy algorithm.

Data Structures used implementation are Min Heap and HashMap.

The project outputs a compressed string with lesser space requirement, the characters and their corresponding frequency count ,the characters and their corresponding code obtained and the reduction percentage obtained after comparing the size of the two strings obtained.
